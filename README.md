WiCS Hackathon 2024 Project 


Barbie Image Processing 

We created a website using React and imbedded the image processor so that users could mess around with the displayed images on the website. For instance, a user could mess around with modifying the bluriness and sharpness, while seeing the photo update in real time to the modifications. The website its self includes 4 different sections including: an introduction to the website, the actual processor, a how to section for users, and an about us section for the team members. We also have a navigation bar and footer that includes the 4 different sections headers that when clicked jumps to the desired section.  

All of the team members have never done much with front end or react which we were able to learn throughout this hackaton. We were able to also learn raw html before we decided to switch towards react. Along with being able to do the back end with connecting the image processing component within react/website.
